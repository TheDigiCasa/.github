## Hi there 👋

# Welcome to The Digi.Casa

TheDigi.Casa is the repository that contains information about my digital homestead that currently is in the planning stages. 


**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

<li>🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?</li>
<li>🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?</li>
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
